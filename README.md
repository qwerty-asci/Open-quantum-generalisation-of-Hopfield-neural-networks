# Open-quantum-generalisation-of-Hopfield-neural-networks
In this final degree project, I will study the quantum generalization of the famous Hopfield network presented in (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1751-8121/aaabcb/meta?casa_token=4W06VWCcEtEAAAAA:ir8rb7l2beAFepOTn2dWebMO0K0izuxBgsdwJluT1VEYGb24cHPmn5c8DMeHrHgcD3vCg9mGnIVNsNnw8cJmRE2iyts). The Hopfield
network is a associative memory model designed with the aim of
converge to one of the stored patterns. The overlap equations will
be derived from the thermodynamic limit by means of the quan-
tum open system master equation. Furthermore, to obtain the phase
diagram in terms of the parameters Î©, which regularize the quan-
tum effects, and T, I will perform a linear stability analysis on the
overlap equations, which measure the degree of coincidence with
the memories. To verify the theoretical results, the quantum jump
trajectories method and the numerical resolution of the Lindblad
master equation will be used to study a finite system of N qubits. Finally, with the aim of verifying that the results obtained
in the macroscopic limit are consistent, the eigenvectors of the Lind-
bladian will be studied.
